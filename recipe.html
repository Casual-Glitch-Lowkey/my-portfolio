    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs pizza dough (homemade or store-bought)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce (for dipping)</li>
        <li><strong>Calzone Filling:</strong></li>
        <li>Black olives</li>
        <li>Sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>Bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>Chopped onion</li>
        <li>Fresh jalapeño pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 450°F with a pizza stone inside if possible
            (or use a baking sheet turned upside down).
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide pizza dough into 8 portions. Roll each portion into a flat disk
            about ¼ inch thick. Add about ¼ cup of toppings to one side of the dough,
            including a generous sprinkle of mozzarella cheese. Fold the dough over
            the toppings and seal the edges.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place calzones on parchment paper. Cut a small slit on top of each calzone
            for steam to escape. Brush the tops with beaten egg and sprinkle with
            parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer calzones (on parchment paper) to the hot pizza stone or baking sheet.
            Bake for 12–14 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool for at least
            10 minutes before serving.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve with warmed pizza sauce or marinara sauce for dipping.
            Other options include garlic sauce, ranch, Alfredo, or BBQ sauce.
        </li>
    </ol>
